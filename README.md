This project has 10 program questions which are solved in Java.  
All the programs are solved in one java file.  

QUESTIONS:

Java Program List - 1

1.	Program to find number of days in a given month using Switch case. Input: month (as int).  

2.	Program that prints Weekday or Weekend based on the day (String) entered by user (using switch case).  

3.	A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in pounds).  

  c(w) = {  
3.5, if 0 < w <= 1;  
5.5, if 1 < w <= 3;  
8.5, if 3 < w <= 10;  
10.5, if 10 < w <= 20;  
}  
 
   Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and display the shipping cost. If the weight is greater than 50, display a message “the package cannot be shipped.”  

4.	Write a program that reads three edges for a triangle and computes the perimeter if the input is valid. Otherwise, display that the input is invalid. The input is valid if the sum of every pair of two edges is greater than the remaining edge.  

5. Program that reads and calculates the sum of integers entered by user. The input 0 signifies the end of input. Example run:  
Enter the integer: 2  
Enter the integer: 3  
Enter the integer: 4  
Enter the integer: 0  
Sum of the integers is 9. 

6.	Program that prints multiplication table of any number entered by user.  
Example run: 5 * 1 = 5  
5 * 2 = 10 (and so on)  

7.	Program to print all the ASCII characters and their integer values in a range entered by user Example run:  
Starting integer: 97  
Ending integer: 100  
97	a  
98	b  
99	c  
100	d  

8.	Program to print following pattern: (input number of rows from user)  
\*  
\* *  
\* * *  

9.	Program to print following pattern: (input number of rows from user)   
1  
1 2  
1 2 3  
1 2 3 4  
1 2 3 4 5  

10.	Program to print following pattern: (input number of rows from user)   
A  
B C   
D E F  
G H I J
